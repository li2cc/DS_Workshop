The topics in the module may seem diverse, covering a variety of matrix functions. Students should have been exposed to these topics in high school and college math curriculum. However, you don't have to learn the math again to be data scientist. Python Numpy and Scipy libraries provide rich functions to automat many math operations. The key is to understand the python APIs and how to packages. \n","  <h3>      [Numpy Package](http://www.numpy.org)    </h3>\n","NumPy is a well-developed Python package for scientific computing. It contains a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n","NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.\n","    # Numpy arrays and scalar\n","    Why do we need arrays while we have Python lists?\n","    1. Efficient operation - smaller storage spaces\n","    2. Uniformed data type in array\n","    3. Vectorization for faster computation \n"," NumPy's arrays are more compact than Python lists. Access in reading and writing items is also faster with NumPy. Today, we are dealing with large datasets, usually gigabytes or terabytes of data. With 64-bit architecture, NumPy would get away with 4 GB limits and has the capacity to process large datasets. \n","“A Python list is an array of pointers to Python objects, at least 4 bytes per pointer plus 16 bytes for even the smallest Python object (4 for type pointer, 4 for reference count, 4 for value -- and the memory allocators rounds up to 16). A NumPy array is an array of uniform values -- single-precision numbers takes 4 bytes each, double-precision ones, 8 bytes. Less flexible, but you pay substantially for the flexibility of standard Python lists!” – Quoted from Python user forum. \n","\n","       "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c2FckyOXZddn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Array Creation"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AhMynTXbZddo","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Create an array\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","#create an array from list\n","a_array = np.array([1,3,5,7]) \n","print(a_array)\n","\n","#convert existing list to array\n","a_list = [2,4,6,8]\n","a_array = np.array(a_list)  \n","\n","#auto conversion to uniform type\n","b_list = [1,'bc','3',4]       \n","b_array = np.array(b_list)  \n","print(b_array)\n","#include members in different data types\n","#the matrix operations won't apply \n","c_list = [[1,2],3,{1:'4'}]    \n","c_array = np.array(c_list)   \n","print(c_array)\n","\n","print(type(c_array))\n","print(c_array.shape)\n","print(c_array[0])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"imksHW9SZddv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Special Arrays"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BSNVda4XZddw","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Create special arrays using built-in functions\n","# empty, eye, identity, ones, zeros, full, arange \n","# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.array-creation.html#from-existing-data \n","\n","# create 2x3x4 dimentional array without value signed\n","print(np.empty([2,3,4]))   \n","# create 2X3X4 dimentional array and assign 0 to all the 24 elements\n","print(np.zeros([2,3,4])) \n","#Return a 2-D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.\n","#It's usually an NxN matrix for identity matrix\n","print(np.eye(4,3))\n","#another way to create identity matrix    \n","print(np.identity(4))  \n","#use arrange to create a 1D array \n","print(np.arange(50,20,-6.3))  "],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tTkEcSqfZdd0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Mulit-dimentional Arrays"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"V1AZ1fPMZdd0","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Multi-dimentional arrays\n","\n","# Create the multi-dimentional list first\n","print(np.array([a_array,b_array]))  \n","\n","# Create multi-dimnetional array from reshaping a one-dimnetional array\n","print(np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4))\n","print()\n","\n","print(np.random.randn(24).reshape(2,3,4))\n","\n","print()\n","\n","print(np.random.randn(24).reshape(3,2,-1))\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Boij7kumZdd4","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Sorting  "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yrcYoGTcZdd5","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#Use numpy sort() to sort matrix members' values \n","\n","#create a 2D array\n","a = np.array([[9,4,3], [3,1,2], [6,4,9]])\n","print(\"The original matrix: \\n\", a)\n","\n","#Sort the array in vertical direction\n","a.sort(axis=0)\n","print(\"\\nSorted in the veritical direction: \\n\",a)\n","\n","#sort the array in horizontal direction\n","#the default axis is the last axis, in this case it's 1\n","a.sort(axis=1)\n","print(\"\\nSorted in the horizontal direction: \\n\", a)\n","\n","#We can also compare the values and return the index numbers of the result\n","#argsort also take directions based on axises \n","a = np.array([[9,4,3], [3,1,2], [6,4,9]])\n","print(\"The original matrix: \\n\", a)\n","print(\"\\nSorted indexes in the veritical direction: \\n\",a.argsort(axis=0))\n","\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zW8hvDu8Zdd8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Other Array Operations"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wbn9forWZdd9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#let's explore the use of other numpy functions\n","\n","#create a 1D array from a list\n","a = [2,3,4,7,-1,0, 123,-5,2,-6,-1,4]\n","a = np.array(a)\n","\n","#convert all the negative numbers to 0 using np.where()\n","a = np.where(a<0, 0, a)\n","print(a)\n","\n","#make the array contain unique numbers only \n","a = np.unique(a)\n","print(a)\n","\n","#quiz: do not use where and unique to accomplish the above tasks\n","a = [2,3,4,7,-1,0, 123,-5,2,-6,-1,4] \n","#the for loop is in low-efficiency\n","for index in range(len(a)):\n","    if a[index] < 0:\n","        a[index] = 0\n","print(a)\n","a = list(set(a))\n","print(a)\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CR4GJMm_ZdeC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Scalar (not Vector)\n","\n","\"The quantity is either a vector or a scalar.
